Analyze the basketball video and extract all key actions performed by players. Identify the jersey number, jersey color, and action type for each event. Provide the results in a structured JSON array format as shown below:

Possible Actions:
- Turnover
- Foul
- Block
- Rebound
- Steal
- 2PT Shot
- 3PT Shot
- Free Throw
- Violation

Output Format:

Return a JSON array where each object represents an individual action:

[
  {
    "player": <jersey_number>,  # integer-like (generally integer value but admit the 00 case), required
    "jersey_color": "<color>",  # string, required (e.g., white, blue, black, green, red, light blue, yellow, purple)
    "action": "<type_of_action>",  # string, required
    "result": <true | false | null>,  # true = made, false = missed, null if not applicable
    "assisted": <true | false | null>,  # true = assisted, false = not assisted, null if not applicable
    "other_player": <jersey_number | null>  # integer-like (generally integer value but admit the 00 case) if another player is involved, null if not
  },
  {
    "player": <jersey_number>,
    "jersey_color": "<color>",
    "action": "<type_of_action>",
    "result": <true | false | null>,
    "assisted": <true | false | null>,
    "other_player": <jersey_number | null>
  }
]

Field Definitions:
- player (integer-like (generally integer value but admit the 00 case), required) – Jersey number of the player performing the action.
- jersey_color (string, required) – The primary color of the player’s jersey.
- action (string, required) – The type of action performed.
- result (boolean | null, required) –
  - true → Successful (e.g., made shot).
  - false → Unsuccessful (e.g., missed shot).
  - null → Not applicable (e.g., turnover, foul, rebound, block, steal).
- assisted (boolean | null, required for shots only) –
  - true → The shot was assisted.
  - false → The shot was unassisted.
  - null → Not applicable for non-shooting actions.
- other_player (integer-like (generally integer value but admit the 00 case) | null, required) –
  - Jersey number of another involved player (e.g., assister).
  - null if no other player is involved.

Example Output:

[
  {
    "player": 23,
    "jersey_color": "blue",
    "action": "3PT Shot",
    "result": true,
    "assisted": true,
    "other_player": 6,
  },
  {
    "player": 11,
    "jersey_color": "white",
    "action": "Steal",
    "result": null,
    "assisted": null,
    "other_player": null
  },
  {
    "player": 32,
    "jersey_color": "red",
    "action": "Foul",
    "result": null,
    "assisted": null,
    "other_player": 15
  }
]

Instructions:
1. Detect and extract all actions in the video.
2. Identify players' jersey numbers and colors.
3. Classify the type of action performed.
4. Structure the output as a JSON array following the specified format.
